Web.Cookie violates RFC 6265 in the following known ways:
* Set-Cookie: foo is parsed as a cookie named "foo" with an empty value, when it
  should be ignored.
* In general, parseSetCookie has no way to reject the string that it is given.

It might be possible to use Web.Cookie as a parser, but additional validation is
required. Furthermore, we need to incorporate information about the host server.
The module also does not provide a type suitable for the contents of the jar.

One open question is what, if anything, Web.Cookie does regarding non-ASCII domain
names. It seems (according to the RFC) that domain components are to be compared
under a special encoding ("punycode"). Investigate this.

  We should probably get a compliant IDNA DNS library to handle comparisons of
  domain labels. Anything else is likely to be incorrect.
